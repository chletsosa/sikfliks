Warm eddies of water circulate in a clockwise direction under the ice cover. The ice melts near the eddy boundary, but not at the eddy center where the currents are weak. The research team is still investigating what causes the eddies, but data suggests that they typically get going in autumn, before ice has covered the lake.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage Credit: Lauren Dauphin, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey and MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS/LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.‚Å£\n‚Å£\n#NASA #Earth #Ice",
